##  Assignment â€“ Working with XML and JSON in R

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(RCurl)
library(tidyverse)
library(XML)
library(knitr)
library(rjson)
library(plyr)
```


## JSON

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
books_json <- fromJSON("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrensimin05/Data_607/master/books.json")
```

```{r}
books_json <- bind_rows(books_json, .id = 'Author')
books_json
```

## HTML
```{r}
books_df <- readHTMLTable(
    getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrensimin05/Data_607/master/books.htm"), header = TRUE, which = 1)

class(books_df)
knitr::kable(books_df)
```
## XML
```{r}
books2 <- ldply(xmlToList(getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrensimin05/Data_607/master/books.xml")), data.frame) %>%
    select(-.id)

class(books2)

knitr::kable(books2)
```
## Conclusion 

All three files are storing information slightly differently.
HTML and Xml data frames are the same , but the json data frame, which was the most difficult for me to implement, transform the data into raws, but I also created the json file a bit differently compare to xml and html. 

```{r}
#xml==html
books_df == books2

```
